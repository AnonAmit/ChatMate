This directory contains the extension icons. You'll need to create your own icon files:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These can be created using any image editing software (like GIMP, Photoshop, or even online tools like Canva or Figma).

The icons should represent the ChatMate brand - perhaps a chat bubble with "CM" or something similar that represents AI-powered chat assistance.

Replace this file with actual icon files before packaging your extension.
